# Xkcd demo apps in Objective-C and Swift.

These are two simple example iOS apps - one written in Objective-C and one written in Swift - that I presented at the [Orlando iOS Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Orlando-iOS-Developer-Group/) on July 17, 2014.

The apps download a list of available [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) comics and present them reverse chronologically.  Selecting one of the comics displays it along with a date and title in a detail view where the UIImageView can be zoomed.

I built the app in Objective-C, and then converted it to Swift so I could highlight some changes and issues when switching to Swift.
